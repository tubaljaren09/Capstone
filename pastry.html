                    <p>Pastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening that may be savoury or sweetened. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery.<br>
                        While pastries are a part of a baker’s offerings, surprisingly enough they don’t necessarily have to be sweet. In fact, pastries come in a variety of sizes, shapes, flavours and textures. What's more, they're made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder and eggs.</p>
