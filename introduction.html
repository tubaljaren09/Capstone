                Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat,
                normally in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on
                hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but many other
                types of foods are baked. Heat is gradually transferred "from
                the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center.

                Whipping up treats in the kitchen can do more than just create
                yummy comfort food, according to a growing range of sources in
                both the culinary and mental health worlds. In fact, baking has
                been found to have therapeutic value which helps to ease
                depression and anxiety. And seeing that one in four people will
                experience a mental health problem at some point in their lives,
                this wholesome therapy is good for the whole family. But watch
                the sugar – how about making healthy versions of your favorite
                treats?

              <h1>1. COOKING IS MEDITATIVE</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                Any activity which takes your whole attention – especially if
                it's simple and repetitive – can have a calming, meditative
                quality. The process of weighing out butter and sugar, whisking
                eggs, beating and folding creates space in the mind, and eases
                negative thinking processes.

              <p>
                The feel of the flour, the sound of the blender, and of course
                the smell of the delectable final product – all these
                experiences stimulate the senses, which in turn increases
                feel-good endorphins.

                Baking – and any sort of cooking or food preparation – is
                ultimately about nourishing ourselves and others. To internalize
                this benefit, make an effort to bring your whole awareness to
                the healthy ingredients and love that go into your baked
                goodies.
